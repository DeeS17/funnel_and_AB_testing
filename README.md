# funnel_and_AB_testing

International Online Store launches a new recommendation system to increase the funnel of events. I will conduct A/B Testing to check the effect of the new recommendation system. To check the effect, I will see if there is a difference in the proportions of event funnels (product page views, product card views, purchases) after 14 days of signing up. The expected results are a 10% increase in the test group compared to the control group.
